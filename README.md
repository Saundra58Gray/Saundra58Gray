## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a Python developer with a focus on building automation scripts and data pipelines to streamline processes and improve workflow efficiency. Pythonâ€™s versatility and vast ecosystem of libraries have made it my go-to language for automating repetitive tasks, processing large datasets, and creating robust, reusable scripts for a variety of applications.

My experience includes developing automation scripts that handle data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, helping teams save time and reduce manual intervention. I use libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and BeautifulSoup to scrape, clean, and manipulate data, ensuring that itâ€™s ready for analysis or integration into other systems. I also work with task automation frameworks such as Celery to manage background jobs and scheduled tasks efficiently.

In addition to automation, I have a strong focus on building data pipelines that enable smooth data flow from various sources into databases or analytical platforms. Iâ€™ve worked with both batch and real-time data processing frameworks to ensure that data is processed in a timely and reliable manner. My goal is to create pipelines that are not only functional but also scalable, robust, and easy to maintain.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set by diving into cloud computing platforms, with a focus on services like AWS and Google Cloud. I am excited about learning how to leverage these platforms to deploy automation solutions and data pipelines, and Iâ€™m exploring how to integrate serverless architectures and containerized applications into my projects.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find projects showcasing my work on automation scripts and data pipelines. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate or discuss any of these projects. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and improve as a developer!
